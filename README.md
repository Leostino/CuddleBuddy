# CuddleBuddy

CuddleBuddy is an application where users can sign up to choose a person/people to cuddle with. The application enables users to choose the person they would like to cuddle with if there is a match between two users. Future developments include adding a chat page where users can communicate and an API for enabling geolocation.
